# Defensive Security & Threat Hunting - Theory

## 1. Threat Hunting Fundamentals

**What is Threat Hunting?**
Proactive search for threats that evade traditional security solutions.

**Types of Hunting:**
- Hypothesis-driven (based on TTPs)
- Intelligence-driven (using threat intel)
- Anomaly-driven (detecting outliers)
- Custom-driven (organization-specific)

## 2. Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

**Characteristics:**
- Long-term presence
- Sophisticated techniques
- Targeted attacks
- Multi-stage operations
- Use of zero-days

**Famous APT Groups:**
- APT29 (Cozy Bear) - Russia
- APT28 (Fancy Bear) - Russia
- APT1 (Comment Crew) - China
- Lazarus Group - North Korea
- APT33 - Iran

## 3. Incident Response Lifecycle

**6 Phases:**
1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons Learned

## 4. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

**Tactics:**
- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Collection
- Command and Control
- Exfiltration
- Impact

## 5. Threat Intelligence

**Types:**
- Strategic (high-level trends)
- Tactical (TTPs)
- Operational (campaigns)
- Technical (IOCs)

**Sources:**
- OSINT
- Commercial feeds
- ISACs
- Government agencies
- Peer sharing

## 6. SIEM and Log Analysis

**Key Log Sources:**
- Authentication logs
- Network traffic
- Endpoint events
- Application logs
- Cloud logs

**Analysis Techniques:**
- Correlation
- Baseline comparison
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern matching
- Machine learning

## 7. Behavioral Detection

**Indicators:**
- Unusual process execution
- Abnormal network connections
- Privilege escalations
- Lateral movement
- Data staging
- Exfiltration patterns

Learning Objectives:
✅ Understand threat hunting methodology
✅ Identify APT techniques
✅ Execute incident response
